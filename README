#_trimmed_1.fq.gz; read 1 from trimmed files
#_trimmed_2.fq.gz

#i ran this on the HPC server (in arrays), that's why it does not have the normal ijp_human or ijp_livestock prefix

#error_files: a folder with all the .err files that were generated by the slurm
#output_files: a folder with all the .out files that were generated by the slurm
#for both, I have deleted the ones that did not really work (because of memory) and the ones that I had to redo because of
#The wormbase Trichuris genome (that was full of bacterial contamination)

#see the script for details on the output files

#_uniq_onlyresultswithreads.txt - these files are the *_uniq.txt files, filtered by awk to see only those lines that had more than 10 reads, as a first check how the mapping worked.

#_genome, I split the fasta.fai files into individual genomes, had to rename those that the gens was common in livestock/humans (Ascaris, Truichuris)

#Had to split ceylanicum and duodenale because they ended up together

#*_genome_10kb.bed - bedtools makewindows output file, for every 'genome', meaning every species

#*_genome_10kb.bed_all_stats - bedtools multicov for all bam files but for one species

#Take these files and mutate them (to normalise for the reads), add the headers and do box plots
